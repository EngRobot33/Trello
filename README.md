### Database
* Open your postgresql shell:
```
psql
``` 
* Create your database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

* Create a user for your database:
```sql
CREATE USER <username>;
```

* Grant all privileges to your database user:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <username>;
```

* Create a Password for your database user:

ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
```


### Django

* First of all clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/Trello.git
```
* Then, we need a virtual environment you can create like this:
```
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate it with the command below:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
* After that, you must install all the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ''

DB_NAME = 'Database name'
DB_USER = 'Database password'
DB_PASSWORD = 'Database password'
DB_HOST = 'Database host'
DB_PORT = 'Database port'
```
* After that, migration:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
* That's finished now you can run the project:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
